While doing so, we also hope to identify factors that are more influential in predicting diabetes which would also make a meaningful impact towards society. By training a classification model on the labeled data, we can test how accurately a diabetes diagnosis can be predicted. This is increasingly important as diabetes is a growing concern around the world. Thus, we hope to leverage past patient data to streamline the process of diagnosing diabetes."],"metadata":{"id":"KPk6k4Fq3AtE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Motivation\n","\n","Recently, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) released a statistic that globally, approximately one in nine adults (total 589 million) are living with diabetes, with an estimated 252 million who are unaware of their condition. This peaked our interest in the topic as well as the medical field in general.\n","\n","With the increasing amount of available healthcare data (including a surprising amount of freely available anonymized data), interest in applying machine learning techniques to diagnostic and treatment approaches has risen. Our motivation in this project is to investigate the potential for using machine learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes based on commonly available features. While this is just a proof of concept, in the future more advanced models could help doctors and patients provide and receive better quality care respectively.\n","\n","Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-250-million-people-worldwide-090000437.html"],"metadata":{"id":"ZGKkvxRvR021"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Related Work\n","\n","Bojun has prior experience submitting to using Kaggle competition datasets as part of Introduction to Deep Learning (11-485) coursework, and is also working on a diabetes-related project for the Information Systems consulting project.
